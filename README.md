Rocket Simulator Project: 
This advanced C++ project simulates the trajectory of a rocket using numerical methods to solve complex equations of motion, integrating concepts from physics and aerospace engineering. The simulation leverages the Runge-Kutta 4th Order method for accurate numerical integration, taking into account gravitational forces, air resistance, and wind effects. Users can customize parameters such as initial velocity, launch angle, gravity, drag coefficient, cross-sectional area, wind speed, and rocket mass to explore how these factors influence the rocket's flight path.
The project also features a graphical visualization using the SFML library, allowing users to see the rocket's trajectory in real-time. The code is organized to provide flexibility and clarity, using structured data to represent the rocket's state and simulation parameters. This project serves as a comprehensive learning tool for students and enthusiasts interested in numerical methods, computational physics, and aerospace simulations. It demonstrates the practical application of advanced mathematics and physics in software development, making it an excellent resource for both academic and research purposes.


Spacecraft orbital mechanics simulator Project: 
This project is a C++ application that simulates the basics of orbital mechanics, allowing users to explore how velocity and altitude changes affect a spacecraft's orbit around Earth. The program uses the Runge-Kutta 4th Order method for precise numerical integration of the equations of motion, taking into account gravitational forces. The orbit is visualized in a 2D plane using the SFML library, making it easier to understand the dynamics of circular and elliptical orbits. Users can customize initial conditions and simulation parameters, making this project an excellent tool for students and enthusiasts to learn about the fundamentals of spaceflight and orbital mechanics.
