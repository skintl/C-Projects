This advanced C++ project simulates the trajectory of a rocket using numerical methods to solve complex equations of motion, integrating concepts from physics and aerospace engineering. The simulation leverages the Runge-Kutta 4th Order method for accurate numerical integration, taking into account gravitational forces, air resistance, and wind effects. Users can customize parameters such as initial velocity, launch angle, gravity, drag coefficient, cross-sectional area, wind speed, and rocket mass to explore how these factors influence the rocket's flight path.
The project also features a graphical visualization using the SFML library, allowing users to see the rocket's trajectory in real-time. The code is organized to provide flexibility and clarity, using structured data to represent the rocket's state and simulation parameters. This project serves as a comprehensive learning tool for students and enthusiasts interested in numerical methods, computational physics, and aerospace simulations. It demonstrates the practical application of advanced mathematics and physics in software development, making it an excellent resource for both academic and research purposes.
